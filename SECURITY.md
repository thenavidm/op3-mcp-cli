# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

[Report it privately](https://github.com/thenavidm/op3-mcp-cli/security/advisories/new).
Please do not open a public issue for a security problem: an issue is visible to
everyone the moment you file it, including whoever would use the bug.

## What this server holds

An **OP3 API token**, if you supply one. Without it the server falls back to
OP3's shared preview token, which is rate limited and reads the same public
data.

The token grants read access to public podcast analytics. It is not tied to a
podcast you own and it cannot change anything, so the blast radius of a leak is
somebody else reading public numbers on your quota.

There is no backend and no telemetry. Requests go to OP3 and nowhere else.

## Write safety

There is no write path. OP3 exposes no write API, so this server reads and
nothing more.

## Untrusted content

Show titles, episode titles and feed metadata come from other people's RSS
feeds. Treat them as data to report on, never as instructions.

## Running it over HTTP

The HTTP transport has no authentication of its own and belongs behind TLS and
an authenticating proxy. The data is public, but an open endpoint spends your
rate limit for anyone who finds it.

## Good-faith research

Read, run and pull apart anything here. Nobody but the maintainer can change
this repository, so nothing you do while investigating puts it at risk.

The care is owed to the service the tool talks to, not to the code. When
testing, use your own account and your own data. Do not point it at somebody
else's, and do not hammer a shared API to the point where other people notice.
If a test could affect anyone but you, stop and send a private report first.

Research done in that spirit is welcome, and nothing here is a trap.
