/**
 * The whole tool surface, as data.
 *
 * These are definitions rather than registrations, which is what lets one
 * implementation serve two hosts that work very differently.
 *
 * Slipway builds the MCP server and the CLI from them, with a single context for
 * the process.
 *
 * Run as a hosted connector, the host imports `ALL_TOOLS` and calls
 * `tool.handler(args, ctx)` with a context built per request, because each
 * caller brings their own OP3 token. Baking a context in at module load would
 * hand every caller the first one's credentials.
 *
 * Order is not cosmetic. A model scanning the list picks the first plausible
 * match, so the cheap rolled-up tools come before the expensive raw ones and
 * the escape hatches come last.
