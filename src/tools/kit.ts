/**
 * Shared plumbing for registering a tool.
 *
 * Every OP3 endpoint is a read, so the annotations are the same on all of them
 * and are applied here rather than repeated twenty-two times where they would
 * eventually drift. A client deciding what to auto-approve can trust that
 * uniformity: nothing in this server changes anything.
 *
 * The error handling is the other reason this exists. An MCP tool that throws
 * hands the client a transport-level failure, which most surface to the model as
 * a bare "the tool errored". Returning `isError` with the message keeps every
 * carefully written recovery hint in `api/errors.ts` visible to the model that
 * needs to act on it.
